Data Description
================

This code generates two data tables each with 68 variables.

The first two variables identify the subject and activity:

subject.ID	an integer between 1 and 30 that identifies the study subject
activity	an activity descriptor: "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", or "WALKING UPSTAIRS"

In the first table, "all_mean_and_std_data", there can be multiple observations for each subject/activity combination.  In the second table, "subject_activity_avgs", multiple subject/activity observations are averaged and compressed into a single row.

The measured variables are described below:


Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'[XYZ]' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

There are 33 'mean' variables (where applicable, [XYZ] represents three distinct variables) which are all decimal numbers:

tBodyAcc.mean...[XYZ]
tGravityAcc.mean...[XYZ]
tBodyAccJerk.mean...[XYZ]
tBodyGyro.mean...[XYZ]
tBodyGyroJerk.mean...[XYZ]
tBodyAccMag.mean..
tGravityAccMag.mean..
tBodyAccJerkMag.mean..
tBodyGyroMag.mean..
tBodyGyroJerkMag.mean..
fBodyAcc.mean...[XYZ]
fBodyAccJerk.mean...[XYZ]
fBodyGyro.mean...[XYZ]
fBodyAccMag.mean..
fBodyAccJerkMag.mean..
fBodyGyroMag.mean..
fBodyGyroJerkMag.mean..

There are also 33 'std' variables which are all decimal numbers.  They have the same names as the above list but 'std' replaces 'mean', for example
tBodyAcc.std...X
